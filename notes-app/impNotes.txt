point 1: difference between functions and methods are function are called independently but methods are
related to the object example like below
let info : {
    let 
    
    
    event = 'someEven',
    eventName : function(){
        console.log('we setup a party name : ' +this.event );
    }
}
here the function eventName is a method related to the object info and can be called as below
info.eventName();
'we setup a party  name someEven'
so in the above code we have an acces to the value event


point when we try use arrow function as methods like the below it won;t work

let info : {
    let 
    
    
    event = 'someEven',
    eventName: () => {
        console.log('we setup a party name : ' +this.event );
    }
}

if we call info.eventName();
//we setup a party name undefined

so we do not have an acces to the value of event
because this in the arrow function have access to the context function or global like 
windows in browser and in nodejs its global
